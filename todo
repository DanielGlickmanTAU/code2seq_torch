- check option of only single value merges..

wait with this for now, to see if can handle after adding max_context_per_method_c2s- adjust vocab size, for when running with less examples



solved:
2/1 terminal with delimnating symbols(e.g \t), cause problems when reading the dataset(pytorch dataloader) line by line
fix: ast_to_graph#convert -> .strip() values..
