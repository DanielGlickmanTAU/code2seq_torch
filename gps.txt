cfg =CM() object.. global object
- how to get it?
??
-how are argsparse args join into it?
method call load_cfg

- how to i make argparse work with my existing config?
chnage main.py call to parse_args(torch_geometric) to my call rows_coloring_main#add_args



models register to network_dict with #register_network



loggers:
there is a seperate logger for train/eval/test

after computing loss/eval metric the training or eval flow calls logger#update_stats

after that the train/eval flow calls logger#write_epoch




loading dataset:
there is a register method called master_Loader
there is plays around with some attributes on the dataset like train_idx etc, because it makes use of pyg-gym stuff.. better not get into it

how i limit the examples: filter idxs_ and pass the list of filtered indexes to pre_transformer_in_memory..



questions:

- should delete this code:  ValueError(f"Loading dataset '{name}' from "
                   f"GNNBenchmarkDataset is not supported.")
